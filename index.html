    <h1>Hi it's shafika </h1>
        <p>I am a 21-year-old law student at Khulna University. My parents' house is in Dhaka. I often feel homesick and tend to commute back and forth between home and university, sometimes I even miss my classes beacuse i'm always coming home. Because of this, I haven't held a part-time job. I'm considering freelancing to earn some pocket money</p>
